# This is Git's per-user configuration file.

# Use this file as base defaults, and override individual settings by:
# 1. Creating another .gitconfig file wherever you want it to live (/path/to/custom/.gitconfig)
#
# 2. At the top of the secondary gitconfig, include this base gitconfig:
#   [include]
#     path = /Users/foo/.gitconfig
#
# 3. In the secondary gitconfig, override whatever specific options you like. For example:
#   [user]
#     email = different.email@otherdomain.com
#
# 4. In each repo where you want to use custom settings, include the override file:
#   git config --local include.path "/path/to/custom/.gitconfig"
